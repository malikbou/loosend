# Loosend

Loosend is a mobile web app designed to help users effortlessly find restrooms near them with the features they require. Loosend was built as part of our final project during Le Wagon's 10 week Web Development bootcamp. The toilets were generated using fake addresses to provide a proof of concept to the idea. You can access it <a href="https://www.loosend.co/">here</a> (just remember to open it in mobile view as it will look weird on Desktop).
